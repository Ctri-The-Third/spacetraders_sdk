# We have just turn the Ship into a client (so it can do things like move, buy sell)
# however now it also needs responses, which has caused a circular import.
# now presently we have one class per kind of response.
# research suggests I need abstracts for this, which I really want to avoid!
# GitHub copilot autosuggested: "this is a bit of a pain, but it will be worth it in the end." :sob:


# I've looked at a couple of libraries by peers. In one case, they don't bother with a custom Response class at all, they just .update() the ship based on the json.
# as a design pattern, this avoids the circular import and lets the ship remain an interactive
# as such, I'm keeping these classes for posterity, but going to switch to the update/ from_json pattern.
